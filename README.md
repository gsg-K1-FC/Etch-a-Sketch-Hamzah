### What is this app? 
- This app is a middle ground between SketchPad and [Etch-a-Sketch game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch)

- When you first land on the page you'll notice a drawing area where you can sketch. 
- To start sketching, press the `s` key on the keyboard then hover with the mouse or trackpad over the drawing area.
- A rainbow colored pattern will be generated following the path you passed. 
- You can stop sketching at any time by pressing `s` again. 
- You can uncolor (make white) any cell by pressing `e` from the keyboard then hover over the cell. Pressing `e` again will deactivate erasing. 
- You will notice edit bar near the top of the page, from which you can do the following
    1. Create a new grid by entering the rows and columns in the respective fields then click (Create) or simply hit Enter from the keyboard
    2. Reset the grid to its original dimensions (16Ã—16) by clicking (Reset Cells) button
    3. Remove the lines of the grid (you can still sketch without the lines) by clicking (Remove Grid) button 
    4. Clear the area by clicking   - you guessed it -  (Clear) button 
- You will also notice another tool set bar to the right of the sketching area, using it, you can do these: 
    - Monitor sketch status (sketch/non-sketch) by keeping an eye on the first icon of this bar.
    - Monitor erase status (erase/non-erase) by looking at the second icon.

### Coloring Modes: 
- There are two coloring modes: 
    1. Rainbow mode: 
    In which a randomly generated color will be applied to the cell you hover over (default mode) 
    2. Color picker mode: 
        - In this mode, you can choose the color you want by pressing the color picker icon to the right of the sketching area
        - Once you are in this mode, you can go back to Rainbow mode by refreshing the page 
- Color Darkening: 
    - This happen whenever you are in the default mode (Rainbow mode) only. 
    - In this, each time you hover over a colored cell its color will darken by 10% 
    - After 10 times the cell is black
